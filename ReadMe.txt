Known Bugs:
Milestone Pages for Milestones with spaces in their names are not created. Need to be slugged.
Whole rows are not clickable, in tables in admin page only content can be clicked.
The scroll element breaks on smaller screens.
I may have missed a few known bugs.

Things Still to be Done:
Styling on most Pages
Selecting a Slider for Portfolio Page
Serving + Layout of Policy and About Page

Dependancies:
multiuploads
